This is my hackweek project, not for production and very hodge podge :)
You'll need 3 things for this to work:
1) an API key for your account
2) a greenhouse URL from Google Calendar
3) a folder (optional) to put the final doc in

And hey, it works so far BUT I haven't fired off Greenhouse APIs yet bc I don't have permission to do so
So stay tuned!
